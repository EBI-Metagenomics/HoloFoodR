  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to determine the sequence and relative abundance of all nucleotides in a biological or environmental sample. A cornerstone of NGS is the quantification of RNA or DNA presence as counts. However, these counts are not counts per se: their magnitude is determined arbitrarily by the sequencing depth, not by the input material. Consequently, counts must undergo normalization prior to use. Conventional normalization methods require a set of assumptions: they assume that the majority of features are unchanged and that all environments under study have the same carrying capacity for nucleotide synthesis. These assumptions are often untestable and may not hold when heterogeneous samples are compared. RESULTS: Methods developed within the field of compositional data analysis offer a general solution that is assumption-free and valid for all data. Herein, we synthesize the extant literature to provide a concise guide on how to apply compositional data analysis to NGS count data. CONCLUSIONS: In highlighting the limitations of total library size, effective library size, and spike-in normalizations, we propose the log-ratio transformation as a general solution to answer the question, "Relative to some important activity of the cell, what is changing?"},

  abstract = {AIMS: The relationship of Atlantic salmon gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacteria to environmental factors, in particular water temperature within a commercial mariculture system, was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Salmon GI tract bacterial communities commercially farmed in south-eastern Tasmania were analysed, over a 13-month period across a standard commercial production farm cycle, using 454 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing. Faecal bacterial communities were highly dynamic but largely similar between randomly selected fish. In postsmolt, the faecal bacteria population was dominated by Gram-positive fermentative bacteria; however, by midsummer, members of the family Vibrionaceae predominated. As fish progressed towards harvest, a range of different bacterial genera became more prominent corresponding to a decline in Vibrionaceae. The sampled fish were fed two different commercial diet series with slightly different protein, lipid and digestible energy level; however, the effect of these differences was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: The overall data demonstrated dynamic hind gut communities in salmon that were related to season and fish growth phases but were less influenced by differences in commercial diets used routinely within the farm system studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides understanding of farmed salmon GI bacterial communities and describes the relative impact of diet, environmental and farm factors.},
